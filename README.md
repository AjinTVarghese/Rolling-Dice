**Dice Rolling Simulator**

This Python script simulates the rolling of a six-sided die, allowing users to generate random numbers between 1 and 6, inclusive. The script uses the random module to produce these random numbers, mimicking the experience of rolling a real die.

**How It Works:**

**Initialization:** 
    
   *The script starts with a while loop that runs as long as the user wishes to continue rolling the dice.*

**Rolling the Dice:** 
   
   *Each iteration of the loop prints a random integer between 1 and 6, simulating a die roll.*

**User Prompt:**
  
   *After each roll, the user is prompted to decide whether they want to roll the dice again. They can input 'y' to roll again or 'n' to stop.*

**Continuation or Termination:**
  
   *If the user inputs 'y', the script will continue to roll the dice.
    If the user inputs 'n', the script will exit the loop and end.*

This simple script is useful for games or simulations where dice rolls are needed, providing an easy-to-use and interactive experience.
